# Everyone has a story to tell
Humans are a wonder of nature. Billions of years of evolution have culminated in us. A species that doesn't have: 
- the fastest reflexes
- the fastest top speed (thanks cheetahs)
- the longest running distance
- the ability to swim the fastest
- the ability to hold our breath the longest
- the sharpest, or strongest, teeth
- the sharpest, or strongest, claws

The list goes on. Yet, we still managed to spread to every continent. And, while we are dwarfed from a biomass 
perspective by bacteria, ants, and many other life forms, we consume a disproportionate amount of the planet's 
resources. To the point that science has shown that our activities have planetary impact. In ~10,000 years, we went 
from worshipping the forces of nature to effectively becoming one as our collective decisions (good or bad) change 
weather patterns and influence the evolutionary process of many other species.

There is even a scientific theory.
